# Updated Portfolio

## Description

A responsive mobile-first revision of my portfolio.  Having just completed the second project in the program, we were tasked to update our portfolio and apply the new technologies learned, in addition to adding our second project to the portfolio section.  Using bootstrap, I created a single-page mobile-first layout with an animation slider (hero section) highlighting the featured projects above the fold.  The navigation features a menu that eases in from the right when clicked.  Each section utilizes the Animation on Scroll AOS library, animating the area to ease in from the bottom of the screen.  The images in the about section use the bootstrap column classes to create a mosaic effect, which scales neatly when the browser window is minimized.  A scroll to the top button appears in the bottom right corner when navigating the page.
